## Elevator Pitch
Our group's main goal is to improve on the uni app, as well as add a few pertinent features of our own to make every UP student's life easier. We realize how time-consuming it can be to have to navigate through each and every sigarra page just to find something like the schedule or grades, so our aim was to have it all in one place for easy access. We asked ourselves what the current app was missing, and came to the conclusion that its schedule could use some work, so we focused on making it more appealing and cleaner, with a more intuitive layout. There were also important features that the app was lacking, so we took it upon ourselves to implement them, such as providing the contacts for each UC's teacher and have the grades show in-app as well.
