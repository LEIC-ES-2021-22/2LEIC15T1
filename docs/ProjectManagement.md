## Iteration Retrospectives

### Iteration 0:
#### [v0.0](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/2LEIC15T1/releases/tag/v0.0)

* Iteration planning and retrospectives: 
  * plans: login implementation;
  * retrospectives: good organization and time management allowed us to fulfill what we initially set ourselves to do.

### Iteration 2:
#### [v1.0](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/2LEIC15T1/releases/tag/v1.0)

* Iteration planning and retrospectives: 
  * plans: creating a functioning sidebar and dummy pages for each feature, with one completed feature. Updating login security;
  * retrospectives: due to lack of time and poor team organization, there was no time to develop any of the dummy pages, which had to be delayed to the following iteration - and as such, this taught us the necessity of planning ahead and having regular team meetings to keep the work flow going.
