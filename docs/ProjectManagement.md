### Iteration 2 ([v1.0](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/2LEIC15T1/releases/tag/v1.0)):

* Iteration planning and retrospectives: 
  * Plans: creating a functioning sidebar and dummy pages for each feature, with one completed feature. Updating login security;
  * Retrospectives: 
    - What went well: we managed to deliver all the required things on time, even if a bit unpolished;
    - What didn't go so well: due to lack of time and poor team organization, there was no time to develop any of the dummy pages, which had to be delayed to the following iteration; We deal with this issue by using the board more often so that our priorities are clear and the team stays focused.
    - What have I learned: the necessity of planning ahead and having regular team meetings to keep the work flow going;
    - What still puzzles me: -
