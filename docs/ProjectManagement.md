    - What still puzzles me: -

### Iteration 2 ([v1.0](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/2LEIC15T1/releases/tag/v1.0)):

* Iteration planning and retrospectives:

  * Retrospectives: 
    - What went well: we managed to deliver the required things all on time, even if a bit unpolished;

    - What have I learned: the necessity of planning ahead and having regular team meetings to keep the work flow going;
    - What still puzzles me: -
